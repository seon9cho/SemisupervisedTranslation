he gave me his word .
he has a large family .
i hate this carpet .
i was threatened .
i finished last .
it 's really impressive .
this is my new tricycle .

she lives just down the street .
tom disappeared into the crowd .
he did it all out of kindness .
the lights are all off .
at last , they came to a decision .
arithmetic deals with numbers .
do you have any money with you ?
i feel like playing , too .
the teacher told him to study english hard .
tom still needs practice .
i only did the bare minimum .
are you flirting with me ?
i can not believe it 's christmas already .

that brings up another point i 'd like to discuss .
i have plans .
the only thing i have now are memories .
the cat is stuck in the tree .
does tom still play the guitar ?
tom wants to know more about mary 's past .
there 's no chance you 're getting away .

a caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket .
i 've never beaten tom at chess .
i will do that work on condition that i get paid for it .
i really do not understand why you think that 's a good idea .
it 's impossible to take on more work at the moment .
she has put on weight recently .
there was no place to buy food .
wait , why am i telling you this ?
i did not walk .
he 's a kind person .
i can not deal with you anymore .
she calmed down .

that does not seem quite so important anymore .

i 've never trusted you and i never will .
she filled the glass with wine .
tom spent the remainder of the night thinking about mary .
i do not have that kind of money .
if you give him an inch , he 'll take a mile .
it matters little whether he comes late or not .
what 's the fastest way to get there from here ?
the doctor thinks tom 's problem is psychological .
you are wrong .
no one warned me .
i checked everywhere .
why did you agree to spend the evening with tom ?
the argument is rigorous and coherent but ultimately unconvincing .
we will not go back to boston .
he was more or less drunk .
do not you worry about a thing .
there is a chance that he will pass the exam .
i trust we understand each other .
tom was the only one in the house .
does anybody have a match ?
i guess it 's too late to do that now .
i 'm going to sleep .
i saw tom kill the neighbor 's cat .
she asserted that she was right .
he denied having done it .
please telephone me before you come .
this question has often come up .
she sang as she walked .

i just can not believe they 're getting married .
i regret not having kept my promise .

i have certain standards .
i had a phone call from him .
i 'd like to ask you a few questions .
i want three pairs of socks .
i did not move .
i 'll be ready next time .
tom did not say that .
i appreciate your answering my enquiry so promptly .
i have some gifts for you .
i prefer traveling by train to flying .
whose friend are you ?
the food is delicious .
my watch is ten minutes slow .
can you explain it to me ?
i feel like i can do anything .
she was very beautiful when she was young .
i am very happy that you have agreed to that plan .
where 's the bathroom ?
the place is worth visiting at least once .
my brother became an engineer .
i believe you have my umbrella .
tom was beginning to feel ignored .
i suggest that you not wait any longer .
he is a nice person .
tom closed the shop early tonight .
i sell cars .
let 's keep quiet .
the chances are that the bill will be rejected .
they were forced to withdraw .
that might be serious .

he is blind in one eye .
she looks better in japanese clothes .
kids are cruel .
i prefer riding to walking .
tom certainly got the message .
i thought tom did a nice job .
that has to be a misprint .
i do not like that woman .
he forgot his name .
someone should notify the next of kin .
all the members of the committee hate one another .
tom is a native american .
i regret having done that .
he is terrible at speaking english .
you 've got a one track mind .
i think you should sit down .
mary is a smart girl .
he was alone in the house .
i think life is what you make it .
i suppose you like it .
i 'm staying at a hotel for the time being .
he likes to play rough .
does he know how she feels about him ?
it really was crowded .
you are no longer a baby .
and now a word from our sponsor .
we have not really thought about it yet .
i immediately built a fire .
everyone did a fabulous job .
i run every morning .
i have no energy today .
careless driving causes accidents .
now i 'm wide awake .

i went to the hospital .
this is not to his liking .
today is extremely hot .
tom has three cars .
i like to study english .
it 's still not ready .
she kicked the door .
after reading his books i feel i can construct a house .
i leave this evening .
someone stole all my money .
we 're blood brothers .
tom has lots of friends in boston .
i think we should stop doing that .
he slowly let the clutch out and drove off .
do you think tom is sick ?
it 's a family secret .
he smoked a cigar after lunch .
shucks ! it was too good to be true .
give a thief enough rope and he 'll hang himself .
are you a doctor ?
he was impatient to see his daughter .
say you understand me .
he put the ring on mary 's finger .
how 's it going to happen ?
he was experienced in business .
he does nothing but read comics .
the entire family lives there in a messy apartment .
why does tom not want to do that ?
the museum is closed on mondays .
you should not have gone there by yourself .
how do you say that in french ?
i just could not take it anymore .
she is giving a party tonight .
please wake me at six .
you 've got everything you need .
it 's a good movie .
well , let 's go .
she kept on working .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
he wrote me a love letter .
we 're fighting .
that man stole all of his money .
wait here for a while .
i am more beautiful than you .
i know that she does not know who i am .
that 's a boat .
he is tall and lean .
there is an urgent need for improved living conditions .
you look positively ghastly .
this is surprising .
i just needed some water .
the french revolution took place in one thousand , seven hundred and eighty nine .
i actually have not been to boston yet .
come to us .
i know tom is finished .
guys are stupid .
how 's your wife doing ?
did you finish your homework ?
with her heart pounding , she opened the door .
she did not give me her name .
it 's a very good newspaper , is not it ?
you did not need to hurry . you got here too early anyway .
do not blame me for this .
she spends a pretty good chunk of time just sitting there and looking out the window .
are you going to go or not ?
i do not have a white shirt .
i will do my best .
i left the country .
come in for a minute .
she has no chances of coming in contact with foreigners .
he climbed the tree without difficulty .
you are my friend .
i love what i 'm doing here .
if tom did not write this , then who did ?
i need to know who i have to give this to .
she cut the apple with a knife .
you should take your car to tom 's garage . he does a pretty good job .
i 'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots .
i 'd better go now .
where is he going to settle down ?
whenever you 're in trouble or feeling down , i 'll be there for you .
i feel better now .
i 'm against it .
what have you done ?
i think it 's unlikely that plants feel pain .
it amazed me .
he kept quite calm .
i 'm horrible with kids .
all of her songs became hits .
i do not want you to go home .
your father 's friends are not his only supporters .
i hope you enjoy the show .
either come in or go out .
it was horrible .
i came into a huge fortune .
i do not think many people can say they are satisfied with their salary .
prices are double what they were ten years ago .
i 'm not that type of guy .
he clung to the hope that he would see her again someday .
who 's your favorite pianist ?
your question has no answer .
come on , help me .
i left my watch at home .
do not get cute with me .
it 's really not that heavy .
you must accept your role .
would you mind leaving the room ?
i am right for once .
all the food was gone .
there was a cherry tree growing in the garden .
i am here on business .
how many proverbs have we learned so far ?
as soon as i can figure out how to send money , i 'll send you some .

it 's not what we want .
i 'm worried about it .
i know tom lied .
this word comes from greek .
i was barefoot .
he left for london yesterday .
tom looked a little frightened .
no one could tell where she was .
i do not think tom will come back .
i met him at the end of the platform .
the dog nipped at me .
he suggested a plan similar to mine .
tom wants to sleep on it .
do you like horror movies ?
you have to give me more time .
tom spoke into the microphone .
i left the room .
no one can deny the fact that fire burns .
sexual harassment has now become a social issue .
do you believe in god ?
i do it because i enjoy it .
we 're sensitive .
i slept very well .
do not you have a full time job ?
there is too much furniture in the house .
he began with a joke .
these two leaves look alike .
he nodded encouragingly .
she eats lunch here from time to time .
i was afraid of being put into a closet .
everyone thinks the same thing .
what would you like to do while you 're here ?
he is engaged in teaching .
be careful not to say anything stupid .
why not spend the night ?
when i was feeding my dog , i noticed that the gate had been left open .
tom thought mary had died .
he drives a pickup truck .
he implied that something was wrong with his marriage .
i 'm sure there 'll be no problem .
you need a license to drive a car .
this is an opera in five acts .
tom told me that he was not afraid of mary .
do you have any idea what happened ?
do not tell anybody .
is everybody ready ?
it would not surprise me .
tom did everything i told him to .
how are you related ?
she told me that she loved me .
i called earlier .
play it cool .
tom asked for my number .
we discussed the problem at length .
i live with my uncle .
i will not tell anybody .
what 's happening ?
have you ever been to america ?
there 's no mistake about it .
he has half as many books as i do .
tom is a good student .
you never told me about this before .
despite the government 's protection , he was the victim of an assassination attempt which killed him .
there 's a lot of chit chat .
tom fell off the chair .
i work in the morning .
what choices do we have ?
it rained hard yesterday morning .
did you get the flowers ?
my house is ten minutes ' walk from the station .
he dropped the cup and broke it .
you have to see it .
do you have enough money to buy one ?
i think you did very well .
do not do it again .
who will you be coming with ?
you can have it for nothing .
he helped me to get over the difficulties .
i have my own reasons .
it 's tom .
what 's in this bag ?
i demand satisfaction .
stop ! you 're making him cry .
i wish i had a reason not to go .
i go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days .
you can trust us .
she is busy learning english .
every action has its consequence .
thank you for your patience .
i was a little put out by this .
i will go with you after i have eaten my lunch .
we must obey .
mary requested a raise from her boss .
why do not you take the day off ?
i saw myself in the mirror .
you can not build buildings on swampy land .
everything comes to those who wait .
my brother is out of work .
he works from monday to friday .
mary looks like her mother , but her personality is different .
it just seemed like the right thing to do .
we met last thursday .
here she is !
thanks to this book , i learned some interesting facts about this insect .
that 's what i 'd try to do .
it is regrettable that you did not start earlier .
the policeman did not believe the thief .
i did ok .
tom ignored mary all morning .
the professor is making a phone call .
no one knew who i was .
i brought you some coffee .
she was perfect .
i tried that .
i want everything to be perfect .
i 'm getting more and more gray hair .
that 's what bothers me .
the answer 's yes .
no one will help us .
i did not know you were a member .
the fire was quickly extinguished .
i could hear doors slamming .
they called their son john .
everything is bad .
i never knew his first name .
it is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands .
i want to do it myself .
i 'm afraid that he can not do it .
he has a test next week .
i 'll miss this place once i leave .
she dyed her hair blonde .
he said that he would come back here tomorrow .
i 'm untalented .
this school has no heating .
i congratulate you on your engagement .
where did you put my gloves ?
i told you it was not over .
we need a new leader .
i do not want to talk to you .
he is in his early thirties .
please accept my sincerest condolences .
as we age , our ability to remember gets worse .
we all know that tom did not win .
i really like that .
do not tell anyone about this .
he will never give in even when he is wrong .
i can not wait to go on a vacation .
i lived abroad for ten years .
i have to go shopping . i 'll be back in an hour .
i like it when it 's snowing .
she got married without her parents knowing it .
i think about it often .
the accident deprived him of his sight .
the nine thirty five train stops at bambury .
i knew exactly what it was .
you owe me something .
fertilizers help plants grow .
make a copy of this report .
the report turned out to be false .
i 'm still shopping around .
i do not think that tom realizes how rude he 's being .
tennis is loads of fun .
he decided to feed his dog the rabbit that he had shot earlier that day .
let 's play a new game .
the police arrested the man who had murdered the girl .
it 's not at all rare to live to be over ninety years old .
you 're invited .
when the lion roars , the zebras tremble .
it will soon be september .
i used to play tennis with him on sunday .
it does not look like anybody 's home .
your car has a broken taillight .
you can go however you like .
the last time i saw tom was in october .
it 's a gorgeous day .
can you lower the price ?
i think everything is functional .
that book is small .
you can count on him .
i want to be certain you are who you say you are .
my uncle went to mexico in one thousand , nine hundred and eighty three , never to come back .
please keep this door locked .
colds are prevalent this winter .
i have a horse .
this is not funny anymore .
this button is loose .
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step .
she used to drink beer .
it was hard .
i see your point .
i do not mind at all .
i love my house .
all of a sudden , large drops of rain began falling from the dark sky .
i 'd like to know if they have arrived .
are you angry with tom ?
tom was heartbroken when his dog died .
people have to obey the rules .
i 'd like to know what you mean .
i stayed there for three days .
you would not be able to handle the pressure .
it 's a secret , i guess .
the baby is growing up .
i 'd rather stay anonymous .
that did not surprise me at all .
where can i find an outlet for all my anger ?
i need to get another lawyer .
the prices in this pastry shop are very high .
this is why i hate him .
i guess i need a little sleep .
tom is going to mary 's birthday party tomorrow , is not he ?
look at this picture .
you were incompetent .
her smile expressed her thanks .
do you really want to put your life in her hands ?
let 's open the window .
i believe we can get that done .
i did not even get a postcard .
the old couple had no children .
that 's an order that i can not give .
i would advise against it .
many young people in spain are unemployed .
it was too difficult for me .
i was working when it happened .
please let me know when dinner 's ready .
he has decided not to go to the meeting .
christmas is only a few days away .
you can ask tom for help .
i 'll decide .
you are now an adult .
she was very happy with my gift .
do not be too dependent on others .
he has engaged in religious activity since then .
he went to london , where he stayed for a week .
tom will buy a house on park street .
does that mean you bought it ?
that was a sign .
i have plenty of theories .
may i use some paper ?
we 'll get in touch with you as soon as possible .
let 's face it , it 's impossible . we 're never gonna make it .
we talk frequently .
i arrived on the night he left .
is there someone here who speaks french ?
he did not get up early .
tom wants an answer .
i can not make heads or tails of what you said .
please open the door .
the day was exhausting .
there was no question about that .
there 's no more time .
the door remained closed .
do you want kids ?
is that necessary ?
he likes money .
i wanted to see you .
the train had already left when we got to station .
i like skiing much better than swimming .
he denied everything .
i 'm a stranger here myself .
tom does not like to be contradicted .
he was just in time for the last train .
do not worry . i 'm good at this .
money does not grow on trees .
the problem with many things is the pre conceived ideas we have about them !
i always wondered what that noise was .
is there anything i must do ?
i slept with the light off .
we happened to meet at the station .
how long do i have to stay here ?
can i go swimming this afternoon ?
i can not figure out how to register a new domain name .
i trusted them .
i will introduce you to my parents .
give me another example .
the plane should have arrived at kansai airport by now .
we found out that he was her father .
i do not like tom at all .
the sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon .
do you want him ?
if you touch that wire , you 'll get a shock .
he 's reading a novel now .
it must 've cost a fortune .
we just want to have fun .
how does it feel ?
the cake is delicious .
i sold it for ten dollars .
i 'm looking forward to spending more time with you .
that goes without saying .
that country has a trade surplus . it exports more than it imports .
tom asked me where he should park .
he asked an awkward question .
please do not compare me with my brother .
tom looked like he was unhappy .
i just want you to think about me once in a while .
i collect silver tea spoons .
i see something moving .
it 's raining everywhere .
how much is the car you are planning to buy ?
he owes his success both to working hard and to good luck .
he is not who he says he is .
i need to be here all day .
tell me something that i do not know .
i do not want my mother to worry .
you 're all crazy .
i 'm really embarrassed .
one of my suitcases is missing .
when i was in school , left handed kids were forced to write with their right hands .
everything was paid for .
i can not stop sneezing .
i do not even have a boyfriend .
wait one moment .
it 's clear that you 're wrong .

tom looks very bored .
oh my god ! what are you doing ! ?
it happened in boston .
how do you take your coffee ?
he must have left the water running .
i have the feeling you had something else in mind .
tom tried to do that yesterday .
my brother in law is really egotistical .
do you want to leave it like that ?
she asked him where he lived .
you will save time if you adopt this new procedure .
it 's too early to get up .
thank you , sir , for your kindness .

it was a tradition .
we 're all wasting time .
where did you get that scar ?
i need to get started now .

there 've been times when doing that has caused us problems .
i 'd like some sugar , please .
they 're in danger .
i forgive you .

she is almost as tall as you are .
i have gotten him into trouble .
i 'm afraid this data is not reliable .
i cut my right hand on a piece of glass .

i 'd like a word with tom .
you might want to grab some sleep .
my mother was usually very busy .
he cured my illness .
the car is waxed and shining .
i talked to the girl you told me about .
is it always hot like this ?
we saw a castle in the distance .
he rang me up at midnight .
i think he 's making a big mistake by turning down the job .

i thought it 'd be worth it .
did you fall in love with her at first sight ?
i can not afford a pay cut .

he slipped on the ice .
i 'm happy to see you in one piece .
there 's a big hole .
when do you mean to start ?
i can not even cook an omelet .

it 's only a temporary solution .
i 'm a cameraman .

tom did not say anything to me .
where did you guys go ?
take a little nap on the sofa .
why are not you ready ?

several dozen young people participated in the demonstration .
they were really unlucky .
how did you discover that ?
the tree fell down .
which came first , the chicken or the egg ?

you can not do it by yourself .

i thought we talked about this already .
there 's one thing that is bothering me .
we can not help you .
it 's noisy next door .

the old man sometimes talks to himself .
i 'll help you to the best of my ability .
this is the right answer .

make sure that the lights are turned off before you leave .
i am a man who can not stand being alone .
excuse me for being late .
what time do you start check in ?
i still have just enough time to get this done , i think .
thank you for your kindness .
she has not seen him for a long time .
what is it you want me to do ?
nobody remembers .
we must talk privately .
i 'll be back at seven o 'clock .
the cat which you found is mine .
do you have one a little smaller ?
tom has really hairy arms .
i feel fine now .
why do not we take him a bottle of wine ?
he came back at about nine last night .
can i help you find something ?
i do not like the way he talks .
i have nothing left to say .
the police say they know you had an accomplice .
the check , please .
i eat a lot .
you can take whatever you like .
i was quite lucky .
i 'm glad you were able to meet tom .
he wants to sell his old car to a man in kobe .
what happened to your voice ?
gestures are very important in human communication .
it 's a good school .
i 'm sure we 're going to win .
she went into the kitchen to see who was there , but there was nobody there .
swimming is one thing i enjoy .
almost everything has gotten better .
i would 've done it .
i want us to be friends again .
what do you want for breakfast ?
i had some things to take care of .
are you in a hurry ?
we are not going on vacation .
cabbage can be eaten raw .
he is constantly complaining .
he told her that she was right .
summer is over .
they started at the same time .
it 's my job to convince you .
i beg you to stay .
this book costs three thousand yen .
i 've got my reasons .
she 's at work , is not she ?
i 'm not afraid of anyone .
this is the dictionary i told you about yesterday .
do not you think it 's weird ?
he lost everything .
i found it rather difficult to make myself understood .
what did your wife say ?
the baby is one day old .
tom does not need to wait any longer .
i believe congratulations are in order .
take heed of her advice .
my father allowed me to go to the concert .
please take more care in the future .
give me a break .
the children are playing outside .
i had nothing in particular to say .
the bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting .
this is a hundred dollar bill .
that 's nothing to be ashamed of .
the apples which he sent to me were delicious .
do you have an alibi ?
this box is too small .
i 'm in charge of security .
mary asked her friends if they thought tom liked her .
i can hear tom singing .
we had fun at disneyland .
come alone .
wash your hands before eating .
i still do not feel safe .
they arrived there before dawn .
he hates running .
did you vote for tom or mary ?
who will look after your dog ?
that 's what i thought you said .
it 's not your problem .
i want you to sit with me .
we were thoroughly satisfied with his work .
she remained single all her life .
he succeeded in business at the cost of his health .
your book is upside down .
he is not what he was ten years ago .
she greeted him cheerfully .
i rang the bell .
i was lonely without her .
you 've put your hat on backwards .
i wish that she would stop smoking .
i planted an apple tree in my garden .
tom was just great .
see you in three months .
tell me about your daily life .
judging from what you say , he must be a great scholar .
i 'll take a nap after lunch .
they relaxed in front of the fire .
tom does not want mary to touch him .
come here after you have washed your hands .
history is more complex than you think .
they like ragtime , jazz and music with a swing to it .
i hope that he will succeed .
i walked in the woods by myself .
this is a big help .
people learn from experience .
over one hundred people were present at the party .
he must be over sixty .
i realized i could not win .
he bowed to his teacher .
how long did you stay at the party ?
she gave me a bag made of leather .
if only he had been there .
i 'll give you five dollars .
tom and mary got married secretly .
i 'm an attorney .
they had a choice .
do not you ever speak to me like that again .
tom is right handed .
i do not think i can help you .
tom died last year .
his family circumstances were such that he became a teacher out of necessity .
our team is two points ahead .
tom stole the ring .
he proved to be an ideal husband .
we still have enough time to discuss it .
i got home a little late last night .
he did the opposite .
do you smell something ?
we went to the museum last week .
i can not see in because the curtains are closed .
that 's probably true .
i 'm not ugly .
speech is silver , silence is gold .
are you looking for work ?
she was a bridesmaid at the wedding .
i 'd buy that .
she sent me a postcard that said she hates the smell of animals .
if i were to tell you all i know , you would be amazed .
there 's a fire in the building . we have to evacuate immediately .
i 'm a student .
tom bends over backwards to please mary .
i 'm at an office party .
that 's a wise decision .
you can not go out there .
tom became extremely weak .
it took me some time to persuade her .
are you sure that you know what to do ?
thank you for your gift .
he stopped drinking .
that 's not even the worst part .
the goods were transported by ship .
he left his umbrella in the bus .
it depends on what you mean .
we must ask the bank for the loan .
you 're going to have to leave .
it is kind of you to give me a ride .
that 's quite a secret .
i met her at tokyo station .
tom disagreed .
i would have bought that car if i 'd had the money .
quit bothering me .
i thought it 'd be fun to surprise tom .
what 's the final count ?
you are a mean person .
never did i expect to see her in such a place .
life goes on .
you are a genius .
are you kidding me ?
give tom some room .
he will be back in a second .
tom made an exception .
smoke appeared .
tom sold his house in boston .
i like both .
can i try this on ?
i am not acquainted with him .
the goose was killed by a fox .
do you really think i had something to do with that ?
he is the older of the two .
a slightly lower interest rate could save thousands of dollars over the life of a home loan .
he speaks english a little .
tom clicked his fingers .
did you ask the price ?
tom should pay what he owes .
today is tomorrow 's yesterday .
the statue is missing its head .
do not release that dog .
the new students entered the hall full of hope .
i have not done this in a while .
just get back to work .
she likes to go to the library .
tom encouraged mary .
it never occurred to me that he might be an escaped prisoner .
what do you want me to do with these ?
we 're still active .
my camera can shoot high definition video .
my mother lives by herself .
i do not believe that ghosts exist .
tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself with the new towel that mary had given him .
i do not work there anymore .
i want you to get your own place .
i forgot to tell tom when to come .
let 's go ask tom .
it will not hurt , i promise .
it is a difficult problem .
tom is not as young as i am .
he found it very hard to keep the conversation going .
i 've checked .
i 'm feeling fine now .
i need to get a haircut .
tell me what happened .
i 'm still sleepy .
a car cut in .
i do not have any friends .
tom has a son named john .
do you have any idea what that is ?
today i got to meet my new philosophy teacher .
i suppose it 's possible .
tom does not have what it takes to be a leader .
is there anything that i should not eat ?
i like what you did .
i had some trouble finding her house yesterday .
the goldfish is alive .
tom does not eat properly .
it was determined that faulty wiring was the cause of the fire .
there is not much hope .
do not you want to meet tom ?
i want to make one thing clear .
my bike has a flat tire .
i do not know anybody in boston .
it hurts so much .
that 's against the law .
i 'm a year younger than tom .
an ugly man knocked on my door .
the man you met at the station is my father .
where do you park ?
tom made good money on that deal .
are you still recovering from last night ?
the concert was incredible .
i had never eaten any kind of thai food , so i was pretty excited about going to a thai restaurant with my grandmother .
let me ask you a stupid question .
tom has not been living here long .
her socks are gray .
she had never been so proud of herself .
she 's sure to succeed .
tom talked .
you are not a spy , are you ?
he had to find another way .
it was almost a decade ago , on may eighth , one thousand , nine hundred and eighty , that mount st . helens erupted .
do you realize what you 're doing ?
these are not words .
i 'm sorry , but i can not answer right away .
it 's not necessary to write more than four hundred words .
where 's the washroom ?
that 's not easy to do .
i 'd take it if i were you .
i am taking my son to the zoo this afternoon .
just as we are talking , there was a loud explosion .
her genius makes up for her lack of experience .
i do not like it any more than you do .
he catches colds very easily .
" i do not have time to spend with my kids . " " you should make time . "
tom felt very tired .
this book is not worth reading .
it 's almost impossible .
i love to travel .
i went to bed after eating .
he walked across the street .
i 'll handle the rest .
i screwed up the very first note .
your chinese is awesome already .
in spite of our encouragement , he decided to throw in the towel .
we are not short of oil in this country .
i should 've listened to you .
i accomplished what i wanted to .
tom laughed nervously .
can i have a paper bag ?
are the children asleep ?
tom said no .
i do not remember agreeing to that .
i 'm not very musically inclined .
he 's the most popular boy in the class .
this is so stupid .
you 're not bruised .
she accompanied me on the piano .
you 'd better start at once .
i 've worked as a waiter for three years .
he broke the door open .
we 're just talking .
mary wore a simple white dress .
i think we 'd better be going .
where are you going this summer ?
daddy , let 's see if you can out stare me .
he balanced himself on a log .
what 's your hobby ?
to the best of my knowledge , this is the only translation available .
summer vacation is soon .
we have four classes in the morning .
i should 've called a doctor .
did you behave today ?
it 's never too late to say no .
i guess i 'm really in trouble now .

where does your friend come from ?
tom tried to tell me something .
that 's as good a place as any .
a lot of books are published every year .
my uncle lives in london .
tom and mary took a selfie together .
we are boys .
he 's already a man .
i think i know why you 're here .
he has a big restaurant near the lake .
something must be wrong with the camera .
a fire can spread faster than you can run .
i was outraged , too .
i have midterms next week .
she caught her breath .
we have little money available for the research .
i 'm sorry that you 've been badly injured .
i think that this was not a wise decision .
tom wants to be strong .
i hope tom is objective .
we prayed together .
he will be a good teacher .
do you want more ice cream ?
can you give me a better explanation ?
tom is doing great now .
that girl is very beautiful .
how do you know i 'm not the one who did it ?
i hope that neither of them were involved in that traffic accident .
you should not have invited tom .
do not drink on an empty stomach .
in general , japanese are hardworking .
let 's spend less time arguing and more time working .
i like girls .
we need to call someone .
i 'd like to apologize .
you have to get this work finished by noon .

a good idea came into my mind .
look what i did .
i crossed the street .

he wanted to come with us .
it might rain tomorrow .
they work too much .
what did you want to tell me ?
have you met him yet ?
maybe it was obvious .
i know what they are thinking .
i nailed it .
everything is working .
which car is yours ?
how long does it take to get to the train station ?
tom showed me what he meant .
the worst thing you can do is to only do something half seriously .
he earns his living as a hotel boy .
i want a raise .

he 's just arrived .
tom needs work .
she poured me a cup of tea .
it 's okay to take it easy sometimes .
i regret saying that .
does it offend you ?
i 'm living in a town .
is anyone else excited about this ?
i knew it would happen sooner or later .
was anybody with you ?
i 'm afraid we can not help you .
what 's the answer ?
i hope i 'm not bothering anybody .
go and get a chair from the next room , please .
the value of a good education can not be measured in terms of money .
i feel the same way about you .
when will your new novel be published ?
she promised to meet him last night .
we 've looked at a lot of things .
we saw it on the news .
my wife is a good manager .
are the police going to arrest me ?
she gathered the pieces of the broken dish .

i 'll call tom and apologize .
i 'm already rich .

i saw you with a tall boy .
you were all a big help .
that 's what 's driving me crazy .
i think tom was looking for you .
my brother is now in australia .
complaining will not change anything .
i can not let you enter without a pass .
she advised him to stop working so much .
" will you pass me the sugar ? " " here you are . "
i did not need your help .
my uncle lives in madrid , the capital of spain .
how do you eat like that without gaining weight ?
there is a river between saitama and chiba .
she can not find her keys .
she speaks as if she were a teacher .
i was homeless for three months .
tom is really shy , is not he ?
my efforts produced no results .
what on earth are you talking about ?
everything has been arranged .
i do not want to talk to you about this .
this is the last game .
that 's really stupid .
i would advise you strongly to do what the boss asked you to do .
that should not be hard for you .
i asked what he was going to do .

i love him despite his faults .
he was excommunicated .
apparently i 'm adopted .
i 'll call him .
why are you so clumsy ?
would you play with me ?
i personally believe that you 're right .
you forgot to buy lettuce .
i owe you my life .
it 's quite spectacular .
i shook hands with tom .
tom has been growing a beard all summer .
i recovered .
wait a minute .
perhaps tom lied to us .
tom is a tailor .
he is washing a car .
i do not want to fail my exams .
i was surprised by tom 's strength .
he 's very experienced .
she advised him to keep his promises .
i 'm fed up with homework .
i 've got a friend at the irs .
if that 's true , then she 's better than me .
do not eat the fruit in the bowl on the table . it 's plastic .
a stewardess was rescued from the wreck .

we climbed higher so that we might get a better view .

i thought we were going to crash .
do you know what this is ?
i know the truth .
our server will be offline on october twentieth for scheduled maintenance .

teenagers often argue with their parents .
i want to be heard .
tom is a little strange , is not he ?

i want you to think about this .
i did not do well on the test so my parents chewed me out .
it was personal .

mary is tom 's stepmother .
what i was looking for was right before my eyes .

my bicycle needs to be repaired .
he was seen crossing the road .
he is enrolled at that university .
i invited my neighbor to breakfast .

i think you knew my father .
his memory never ceases to astonish me .
she was anxious about her children 's health .
perseverance , as you know , is the key to success .
thank you very much , doctor .
he despised those who lived on welfare .
is there something wrong ?
i was just trying to be helpful .
is he interested in me ?
tom was caught speeding .
he knows better than to believe such a thing .
do you have a bottle opener i could use ?
is it something very serious ?
tom quietly opened the door and tiptoed into the room .
what time did the meeting end ?
if he does not come , what will you do then ?
he gave me ten thousand yen .
please lend me this book for a few days .
that 's not important , is it ?
the view is amazing .
i 'm really flattered to hear that .

she fainted .
i 'm resilient .
the tire leaks air .
your friends are late .

if you want me to help you , all you have to do is ask .
watch out for thieves around here .
when was the last time you slept in this room ?
how did you hurt your back ?
please sum up your idea .
a room without books is like a body without a soul .
tom wishes he could swap places with mary .
how do you know which one is yours ?
she read the article over and over again .
what 's happened here is a travesty .
i can not order tom to do it .

i 'd like to learn to play the harp .
this coat fits me well .

i 'm going to reconsider it .
it 's not us who did it .
i get depressed at times .
i 'm not talking to you , tom .
they tried a third time .
tom told me he did not take french in high school .
why do you ask ?
this is not a bad thing .
open the windows to let in some air .
the allies wasted no time .
war is hell .
i want to take a closer look at that .
tom felt responsible .
do not you ever come back .
her unexpected visit got him all worked up .
as soon as i got home , the telephone rang .
how long are they ?
i forgot to pay for the drinks .
if you really like mary , you should ask her out .
she accepts criticism from anyone but her parents .
where is your room ?
i 'm sympathetic .
she is absorbed in her study .
we are playing tennis this weekend .
tom told me that he liked working with mary .
all the lights in the building have gone out .
this beef is good .
i wonder if you ever think of me .
that 's not very nice .
that smells delicious .
i believe what is written in her letter .
i do not know whether to accept or refuse .
i want more detailed information .
everybody had a good year .
where should i put my laundry ?
we have lots of important things to do .
what 's the most interesting place you 've ever visited ?
it could 've been a lot worse .
i will not mention it again .
can anything else be done ?
tom is confused and scared .
she fell in love with him the first time she met him .
he earned as much money as possible .
you 're disgusting .
there is nothing i can do to change that .

i will do whatever you ask .
i 've gotta go to the bathroom .
i got it .

i saw him once .
i was reading a book while walking .
he rescued the child from the burning house .
he asked us not to make any noise .
i appreciate your patience .
am i disturbing you ?
i knew this was a bad idea .
i do not know if there is time .
he is something of a musician .
i 'm probably not the only one that needs to do that .

that 's what i love about tom .
i wanted to see tom .
he 's leaving for tokyo tomorrow .
i do not want to hurt anyone .
that 's not the way i see it .
your dream may come true at any moment .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the spur of the moment .
there are a lot of things you do not know about my personality .
the house was deserted .
i lost my key .

i was expecting you .
they would not have done anything .
please lend me the video when you have seen it .
i know you 're right .

tom works too much .
